## Demo app
The demo app is an internet classic - the humble [todo app](http://todomvc.com). It's a great for demoing this project because the problem is well-known and well-defined but simple enough to allow for any number of interpretations - even with the same stack.

### How to run it

### How it works
The requirements for our demo app are as follows:

- A todo can be added, edited or deleted
- A todo can be active or completed
- Todos can be filtered by status
- A counter of active todos is displayed at the bottom
- Completed todos can be deleted at once
